## Overview
I built a chrome extention, which blocks every website except the ones you whitelist. It has also a nice screen like momentum, where you can completely focus on your tasks

- block every website
- whitelist websites
- clean and modern starting screen
- challenges you have to do in order to unlock websites for a few minutes

## Outcomes
- nice chrome extention
