## The Challenge
„Design and develop a bold, high-energy landing page for a fictional premium protein bar brand – targeting Gen Z fitness enthusiasts and gym-goers aged 16–28 who resonate with influencer-driven brands like Feastables or Prime."

## My Approach
- Research: Analysed top-performing Gen Z food & fitness brands (Feastables, Prime, Barebells, Grenade) – identifying patterns: dark themes, oversized typography, neon accents, aggressive CTAs
- Design: Dark theme with vibrant neon-green accents – because the target audience associates dark, bold aesthetics with premium fitness products and energy
- Structure: Impact-first page architecture: Full-screen Hero → Bold Product Grid → Nutrition Facts → Social Proof → Reviews → CTA

## Key Features
- Dark UI with neon-green accent color for high contrast and visual impact
- Fully responsive layout (Mobile First)
- Scroll-triggered animations and staggered fade-ins
- Floating product image animation in the Hero section
- Marquee trust bar with continuous scroll
- Counter animations for social proof numbers
- Conversion-optimized CTA placement throughout the page
