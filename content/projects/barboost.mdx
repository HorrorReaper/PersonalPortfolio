## The Challenge
„Design and develop a landing page for a fictional premium protein bar brand that communicates natural ingredients, trust and sustainability, which targets health-conscious consumers aged 20–35."

## My Approach
- Research: Analysing successful B2C-Food-Brands like RXBar or Clif Bar, what worked on their website, like colors, layout and conversion-elements?
- Design: Light, natural color scheme (shades of green + warm beige) instead of the typical dark fitness look, because the target group expects trust and naturalness, not aggression.
- Structure: Conversion-optimized page structure: Hero → Trust → Products → Nutritional values → Social proof → Newsletter → Footer

## Key Features
- Fully responsive (mobile first)
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Interactive nutritional information display
- Conversion-optimized CTA placement
- Performance-optimized (lazy loading, WebP)
